        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>I'm Juan Valdez, a licensed Wastewater operator with the City of Houston and a proud member of WEAT,TWUA and the Texas Stream Team.
            I work at the intersection of infrastucture, public health, and enviormental sustainability. 
            Currently I'm pursuing my Bachelors degree in business marketing at the UNiersity of Houston-Downtown. with plans to attned LAw school. my long term Goal is to become an enviormental lawyher focused on water justice, compliance accountability and equitable infrascture planning. 
            My expirience in wastewater operations has shown me how deeply public systems affect community well-beign and how often the most vulnerable are left out of the decisions that impact their enviroment. I'm commited to changing that by combining technical knowledge with legal advocacy and civic engagement 
            This site serves as a Hub for my work, projects and purpose always looking ahead.
