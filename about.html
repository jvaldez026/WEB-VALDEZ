            <!---why it matters/personal-->
        <p>I believe everyone deserves a high quality of life. I want to use the law to educate communities about their rights and give them the tools to advocate for themselves.

Working in wastewater, I’ve learned how public systems work—and how often those systems fail the people who need them most. Infrastructure decisions are often made behind closed doors or communicated in ways that leave people confused, discouraged, or powerless.

No matter how efficient or compliant a treatment plant is, it won’t serve its community if people don’t have the language, access, or power to hold it accountable. I’ve seen how technical jargon, bureaucracy, and legalese lead to overlooked and neglected public systems. My goal is to change that</p>
